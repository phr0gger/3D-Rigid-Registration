# 3D-Rigid-Registration
Python implementation of J. Cashbaugh and C. Kitts, "Automatic Calculation of a Transformation Matrix Between Two Frames," in IEEE Access, vol. 6, pp. 9614-9622, 2018, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2799173.

Calculates a homogeneous transform between two frames given a set of matched pairs of position measurements from the point of view of each of the reference frames.

For comparison, Horn's method as implemented by Jack Hunt (https://github.com/JackHunt/HornsMethod) is included.
